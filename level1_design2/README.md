# Sequence Detector Design Verification


![](../assets/seq_dectect_workspace.png)

## Verification Environment
The testbench drives inputs to the Design Under Test using dut.&lt;input-port-name&gt;.value = &lt;value&gt;

The sequence detector is a sequencial device, which uses a clock.
In CoCoTb, we simulate clock using
```
from cocotb.clock import Clock

clock = Clock(dut.clk, 10, units="us")  
cocotb.start_soon(clock.start())    
```
Here, *dut.clk* is the input clock port of the DUT, 10us clock is generated. *start_soon* function starts the clock


The awaiting until the edge of the clock is done using *RisingEdge* or  *FallingEdge* function from **cocotb.triggers** as
```
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
```

The values are assigned to the input port using (awiting until the clock edge to pass on to next instruction)
```
dut.inp_bit.value = 1
await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
```

The assert statement is used for comparing the output from the sequence detector with the expected value.

```
assert dut.seq_seen == out[i], f"Incorrect Operation\nExpected : {out[i]} \t Got: {dut seq_seen.value}"
```

We can log the output from the DUT using `dut._log.info()` 


## Test Scenario 1
inp = [1,0,1,0,1,1]

out = [0,0,0,0,0,1]

## Test Scenario 2
inp = [1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1]

out = [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]

## Test Scenario 3
inp = [0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]

out = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]

Output mismatches for the above inputs shows that there are design bugs

## Bug
Based on the above test input and analysing the design, we see the following

![](../assets/seq_detect_bug.png)

- The next state for SEQ_1 for 1 input should be SEQ_1 instead of IDLE

- The next state for SEQ_101 for 0 input should be SEQ_10 instead of IDLE

- For SEQ_1011 state, we add state transition to SEQ_1 for 1 input

## Design Fix
Updating the design and re-running the test makes the test pass.

The updated design is checked in as seq_detect_1011_corrected.v

## Verification Strategy
Randomly assign and verify the logic given, check if the design functions as per the design specifications. For example, 
- Try 1011 , it gives correct output, now add some more bits 
try 11011, which shows one bug
- Next try 1101011 which points yet another bug. In the same way we can capture the bug

## Is the verification complete ?
 Verification is complete, many test cases have been simulated. But there may be certain edge cases that may cause the design to fail.
